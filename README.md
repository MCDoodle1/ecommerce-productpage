## My process

I started by writing the HTML and decided on layout and divisons in components. Then I wrote the React functionality for the menu, cart, lightbox and buttons and finally the CSS to style the page. 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design
- [BEM](https://en.bem.info/methodology/css/) - BEM Methodology
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) - Sass documentation


### What I learned

This was my first time to code a shopping cart in React. 

### Continued development

Design a commercial webpage with multiple items that gets its data from an API, including a functioning login and payment page.
